-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements
------------
Tool: ModusToolbox™ IDE
Programming Language: C
Associated Parts: All PSoC 6 MCU parts

Software Setup
--------------
This code example requires a PC terminal emulator to get and set the time 
information.

Open terminal software such as Tera Term and select the KitProg3's COM port 
with a baud rate setting of 115200 bps, data bits 8, parity none, and stop 
bit 1. Make sure the terminal sends a line feed (LF) character for a new line,
and enable local echo to see entered commands.

Supported Kits
--------------
PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit
PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit
PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Prototyping Kit

Overview
--------
This code example demonstrate how to read and write the current time using a
 RTC component in PSoC 6 MCU using ModusToolbox™ IDE.

Build and Program
-----------------
Select any project in the application.
In the Quick Panel click the <application name> Program (KitProg3) link.
The IDE builds the application, programs the kit, and starts execution.
