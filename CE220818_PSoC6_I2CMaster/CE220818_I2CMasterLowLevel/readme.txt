Overview
--------
This example project demonstrates the basic operation of the I2C master resource. 
The I2C master SCB sends a command packet to the I2C slave SCB to control an user LED.
Three applications developed in this example are: I2C master using high-level APIs, 
I2C master using low-level APIs and I2C master communication with EzI2C slave.
