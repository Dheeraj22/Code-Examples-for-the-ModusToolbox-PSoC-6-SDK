CE218552_ CE218552_DMA_UART2MemoryBuffer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements
------------
Tool: ModusToolbox™ IDE
Programming Language: C
Associated Parts: All PSoC 6 MCU parts

Supported Kits
--------------
PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Prototyping Kit

Overview
--------
This example demonstrates how a PSoC® 6 DMA channel transfers data received 
from the UART to a buffer in memory. When the buffer is filled, a second DMA 
channel drains the buffer to the UART, to be echoed back.

Build and Program
-----------------
First, select any project in the application. 
In the Quick Panel click the <application name> Program (KitProg3) link.
The IDE builds the application, programs the kit, and starts execution.
