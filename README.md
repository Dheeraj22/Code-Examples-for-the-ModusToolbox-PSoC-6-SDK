## Overview

These examples demonstrate the peripherals and basic functionality of the PSoC 6 MCU. Each example has a readme.txt, and a comprehensive PDF document that explains what to do and what to observe when running the example.

## Creating the Code Example

Download the example and unzip the repository onto your local machine. You can also clone the repository into a location on your local machine.

In the ModusToolbox IDE, use **File > New > ModusToolbox IDE Application**. Pick your kit or device. You must use a supported kit or device as noted in the Requirements section above.

In the **Starter Application** window, click the **Browse** button and navigate to the _modus.mk_ file for the example. Click **Next** and complete the application creation process.
Then import all the projects in the archive or root directory.
