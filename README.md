# WICED-SDK-with-PSoC-6-Support-Examples using MOdusToolbox<sup>TM</sup> IDE
This repository is a "Table of Contents" for the many ModusToolbox IDE code examples that are coming, and for resources available to you as a MOdusToolbox developer. As code examples appear, this document will link to them. Until then, use this to locate PSoC 6 MCU and SDK resources.

# Importing a Code Example

We assume you're familiar with GitHub. You may need a little help understanding how to get the example into the IDE.

When you go to the repository, you can download or clone the repository. The IDE import process starts the same either way.

Use **File** > **Import** > **General** > **Existing projects into workspace**.

*If you downloaded a zip*: enable the **Select Archive File** option and browse to locate the archive (zip file)

*If you cloned*: enable the **Select root directory** option and browse to locate the directory where you cloned the example.

Then import all the projects in the archive or root directory. Most code examples have a PDF document that explains the code example. You will find that PDF file in the code example folder. Or you can read it right here on GitHub.

# Code Examples 

Cypress provides a rich set of code examples for the PSoC 6 MCU, using the ModusToolbox IDE. PSoC 6 MCU bridges the gap between expensive, power hungry application processors and low‑performance microcontrollers (MCUs). The ultra‑low‑power, dual-core architecture of PSoC 6 MCU offers the processing performance needed by IoT devices, eliminating the tradeoffs between power and performance.

Code examples are grouped by category. The same code example may appear in more than one category. All the code examples come with well documented design guidelines to help you understand the design and how to develop it. Feel free to explore the code example source files and let's innovate together! 

This ReadMe also includes information about ModusToolbox software, links to avaliable kits, and programming resources for PSoC 6 MCU.
