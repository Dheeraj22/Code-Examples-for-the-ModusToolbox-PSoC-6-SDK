## Overview

These examples demonstrate the peripherals and basic functionality of the PSoC 6 MCU. Some examples demonstrate more complex solutions. Each example has a readme.txt, and a comprehensive PDF document that explains what to do and what to observe when running the example.

The code examples in this repository all use [ModusToolbox™ IDE](http://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-integrated-design-environment-ide) and the C language.

The specific supported kits and parts vary per example. Review the readme.txt or the PDF file for each example. Most examples support all [PSoC 6<sup>®</sup> MCU](http://www.cypress.com/PSoC6) parts

Supported kits include [PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit](http://www.cypress.com/go/cy8ckit-062-ble), [PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-6-wifi-bt-pioneer-kit), and [PSoC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit](http://www.cypress.com/cy8cproto-062-4343w).

You can browse the code examples in the repository, or use GitHub's search capabilities to find a particular symbol or term. Just type the term into the search box and search in this repository.
